  summary: Cases of using Netezos - a package of .NET Standard libraries for working
  with Tezos blockchain

Netezos is a package of .NET Standard 2.0 libraries for working with Tezos. At this stage, `Netezos.Rpc` and `Netezos.Keys` are implemented. Letâ€™s dive a little deeper and see how it works.

## Installation

[`Netezos.Rpc`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Netezos.Rpc/) and [`Netezos.Keys`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Netezos.Keys) packages are available on NuGet, a package manager for .NET developers. Thus, you can install the packages via the Nuget Package Manager graphical interface or the following command:

```shell
PM> Install-Package Netezos.Keys
```

Or just clone the project from our [GitHub](https://github.com/baking-bad/netezos) repository:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/baking-bad/netezos
```

## Letâ€™s get it started!

To get started, we need an account with funds. There are two ways to do this: to activate a new account from a JSON file, or a much simpler way to get money from the [Faucet Telegram Bot](https://t.me/tezos_faucet_bot). Letâ€™s consider both of them.

## Using faucet bot

Letâ€™s generate a new key and get test coins from the telegram bot:

```csharp
var key = new Key();
Console.WriteLine($"Secret key: {key.GetBase58()}");
Console.WriteLine($"tz Address: {key.PubKey.Address}");
```

> _NOTE: Save secret key and tz address, weâ€™ll need them in the next step._

Letâ€™s go to the [Faucet Bot](https://t.me/tezos_faucet_bot) and get some test coins. You can use the `ðŸ¤‘ Get coins` option to deposit 100 êœ© to your tz address, or `âž• Add subscription` and set `Amount` to ensure your balance is always non-zero.

## Activation via JSON

First of all, letâ€™s download a JSON file from [https://faucet.tzalpha.net/](https://faucet.tzalpha.net/ "https://faucet.tzalpha.net/") and parse the data:

```csharp
var words = new List<string>
{
  "salmon","solar","alone","prosper","almost","length","impose",
  "toilet","edit","seed","curtain","coyote","zoo","unaware","pause"
};
var secret = "693d026e9d3127e781be859bcd13c5cddebfc980";
var password = "XUWmCcdSbP";
var email = "jqlpsrbl.obkysflu@tezos.example.org";
```

We can use that to extract the private key:

```csharp
var mnemonic = new Mnemonic(words);
var key = Key.FromMnemonic(mnemonic, email, password);
```

This is the most frequent use case, but you have multiple options though:

```csharp
var keyFromBase58 = Key.FromBase58(key.GetBase58());
var bytes = Base58.Parse(key.GetBase58());
var keyFromBytes = Key.FromBytes(bytes);
var hex = Hex.Convert(bytes);
var keyFromHex = Key.FromHex(hex);
```

**Note:** _Currently we support ed25519 and secp256k1 curves._

Now, that we have received the key, we can activate the account. We will use `Netezos.Rpc` package for that purpose. Read all about it [in this blogpost](https://link.medium.com/sNTgVzimd1).

## Account activation

Letâ€™s create a content list for our future operation. The `pkh` and `secret` fields are taken from the downloaded JSON file:

```csharp
var content = new List<object>
{
   new
   {
       kind = "activate_account",
       pkh = key.PubKey.Address,
       secret
   }
};
```

Then letâ€™s create an RPC object and get the required data from the chain:

```csharp
var rpc = new TezosRpc("https://rpc.tzkt.io/babylonnet/");
var branch = await rpc.Blocks.Head.Hash.GetAsync<string>();
var opBytes = await rpc.Blocks.Head.Helpers.Forge.Operations.PostAsync<string>(branch, content);
```

Once we get operation bytes we can sign them with our key and broadcast to the network:

```csharp
var signedBytes = key.Sign(Hex.Parse("03" + opBytes));
var opHash = await rpc.Inject.Operation.PostAsync(opBytes + Hex.Convert(signedBytes));
Console.WriteLine(opHash);
```

## Public key revelation

After successful account activation, we will perform the reveal operation.

First, one has to get a fresh counter value and public key hash to build an operation content:

```csharp
var counter = await Rpc.Blocks.Head.Context.Contracts[key.PubKey.Address].Counter.GetAsync<int>();
var revealContent = new List<object>
{
   new
   {
       kind = "reveal",
       source = key.PubKey.Address,
       fee = "1267",
       counter = (++counter).ToString(),
       gas_limit = "10100",
       storage_limit = "0",
       public_key = key.PubKey.GetBase58()
   }
};
```

Next steps are similar to the activation operation:

```csharp
var revealOpBytes = await rpc.Blocks.Head.Helpers.Forge.Operations.PostAsync<string>(branch, revealContent);
var revealSignedBytes = key.Sign(Hex.Parse("03" + revealOpBytes));
var revealOpHash = await Rpc.Inject.Operation.PostAsync(revealOpBytes + Hex.Convert(revealSignedBytes));
Console.WriteLine(revealOpHash);
```

## Transaction

And finally, we can make a transaction.

Preparing an operation content first:

```csharp
var balance = await Rpc.Blocks.Head.Context.Contracts[key.PubKey.Address].Balance.GetAsync<long>();
var trContent = new List<object>
{
   new
   {
       kind = "transaction",
       source = key.PubKey.Address,
       fee = "1282",
       counter = (++counter).ToString(),
       gas_limit = "10307",
       storage_limit = "0",
       amount = (balance - 1285).ToString(),
       destination = "tz1KhnTgwoRRALBX6vRHRnydDGSBFsWtcJxc"
   }
};
```

Taking forge-sign-inject steps:

```csharp
var trOpBytes = await rpc.Blocks.Head.Helpers.Forge.Operations.PostAsync<string>(branch, trContent);
var trSignedBytes = key.Sign(Hex.Parse("03" + trOpBytes));
var trOpHash = await Rpc.Inject.Operation.PostAsync(trOpBytes + Hex.Convert(trSignedBytes));
Console.WriteLine(trOpHash);
```

Thatâ€™s it! Local forging and automatic content fill will be implemented and documented a bit later, so stay tuned.  
We would also like to remind you that Netezos is an [open-developing](https://github.com/baking-bad/netezos/tree/develop) project, and any kind of contribution is highly appreciated!

Cheers!
