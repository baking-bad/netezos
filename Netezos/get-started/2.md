Netezos is a .NET Standard 2.0 library for working with Tezos. In this blog post, weâ€™ll show you use cases of working with local forging and Tezos Ledger App.

## Installation

[Netezos.Forge](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Netezos.Rpc/) and [Netezos.Ledger](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Netezos.Rpc/) packages are available on NuGet, a package manager for .NET developers. Thus, you can install the packages via the Nuget Package Manager GUI or the following commands:

```bash
PM> Install-Package Netezos.Forge
PM> Install-Package Netezos.Ledger
```

Or simply clone a project from the GitHub repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/baking-bad/netezos
```

## Getting a public key from the ledger

First of all, we will connect to the ledger and get the address from it.

```csharp
var ledger = (await TezosLedgerClient.GetHIDLedgersAsync()).First();
var pubKey = await ledger.GetPublicKeyAsync();
Console.WriteLine($"Public key: {pubKey.Address}");
```

Letâ€™s go to the [Faucet Bot](https://t.me/tezos_faucet_bot) and get some test coins. You can use the `ðŸ¤‘ Get coins` option to deposit 100 êœ© to your tz address, or `âž• Add subscription` and set `Amount` to ensure your balance is always non-zero.

## Sending operations

Letâ€™s create an RPC object and get the required data from the chain:

```csharp
var rpc  = new TezosRpc("https://rpc.tzkt.io/babylonnet");
var head = rpc.Blocks.Head;
var contract = head.Context.Contracts[pubKey.Address];
var branch = await head.Hash.GetAsync<string>();
var counter = await contract.Counter.GetAsync<int>();
var manager = await contract.ManagerKey.GetAsync<string>();
```

Then we can prepare list of operation content

```csharp
var content = new List<ManagerOperationContent>();
if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(manager))
{
    content.Add(new RevealContent
    {
        Source = pubKey.Address,
        Fee = 1267,
        Counter = ++counter,
        GasLimit = 10100,
        StorageLimit = 0,
        PublicKey = pubKey.GetBase58()
    });
}
content.Add(new TransactionContent
{
    Source = pubKey.Address,
    Fee = 1287,
    Counter = ++counter,
    GasLimit = 13805,
    StorageLimit = 326,
    Amount = 100,
    Destination = "tz1KhnTgwoRRALBX6vRHRnydDGSBFsWtcJxc"
});
```

And now the most interesting thing. Letâ€™s make our transaction really safe. Weâ€™ll use a local forging because we donâ€™t trust anyone:

```csharp
var operationBytes = await new LocalForge().ForgeOperationGroupAsync(branch, content);
```

Next, we make it even safer and send it to the ledger for signing:

```csharp
var signatureBytes = await ledger.Sign(Hex.Parse("03").Concat(operationBytes));
```

And finally, we can send it to the node to inject an operation:

```csharp
var opHash = await 
  rpc.Inject.Operation.PostAsync(Hex.Convert(operationBytes.Concat(signatureBytes)));
Console.WriteLine(opHash);
```

Here we go! Now we can check the hash of the operation: [https://babylon.tzkt.io/oojc52Qhi7Bzr3fp9Xkb4DWs9jSZ5kFwkf518LYACwRNahmAgui](https://babylon.tzkt.io/oojc52Qhi7Bzr3fp9Xkb4DWs9jSZ5kFwkf518LYACwRNahmAgui)

Automatic content filling is currently in work, also we will provide more documentation for Netezos, so stay with us!

We would also like to remind you that Netezos is an [open-developing](https://github.com/baking-bad/netezos/tree/develop) project, and any kind of contribution is highly appreciated!

Cheers!
